The objective of the project is to use OpenGL to create a 2x2 Rubik's Cube. This program will be an interactive tool that offers users a way to handle a simulated Rubik's Cube along with features that help with puzzle comprehension and solution. The simulation will include cube solving algorithms, interaction with users, and graphic rendering.

Problem solving and algorithms: Cube Representation: The cube will be represented as a 3D model with each mini-cube (or cubie) having distinct colors on its faces. Rotation Logic: Implementing algorithms that accurately rotate the faces and the whole cube while maintaining the state of each face. Solving Algorithm: An optional feature that provides users with step-by-step solutions based on the cube's current state. User Interaction: Handling user inputs to rotate the cube and shuffle it.

Design consideration Model: The cube's 3D model will be designed to visually replicate a real 2x2 Rubik's Cube, with each mini-cube rendered in 3D and colored appropriately. View: A graphical user interface (GUI) will allow users to view the cube from different angles and interact with it. The view will be implemented using OpenGL, providing a real-time 3D rendering of the cube. Controller: The application will handle user inputs for cube rotations, shuffling, and solving. It will include keyboard and mouse controls for a more intuitive interaction.


RIGHT NOW RUBIKS CUBE DOES NOT ROTATE!!!
